// takes another function as argument
// return a function as result

// Map function - 
//for example :

const result=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
const squareResult = result.map((num) = num*num)

//what is difference between normal & callback function
//A callback function is passed as an argument to another function and executed later.
// a function that is directly called in the code is known as normal function.
